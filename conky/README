Make sure you change your location code in the conkystats config 
to get accurate weather reports. The location code uses Accuweather's
system. For people in the US it is your zipcode.

Start up conky for each conky config. For example:
conky -c ~/.config/awesome/themes/nice-and-clean-theme/conky/conkydate &
conky -c ~/.config/awesome/themes/nice-and-clean-theme/conky/conkyhr &
conky -c ~/.config/awesome/themes/nice-and-clean-theme/conky/conkymin &
conky -c ~/.config/awesome/themes/nice-and-clean-theme/conky/conkystats &

This conky theme goes well with the "Nice and Clean" awesome window 
manager theme, which is based off of ghost1227's openbox work.
